<h3>Details</h3>

<p>JT Nimoy (<a href="https://medium.com/@jtnimoy/its-never-been-a-secret-c361f734ffa8" title="It's never been a secret.">she/her</a>, formerly Joshua) is a humanist technologist multidisciplinary in Silicon Valley, Northern California. Nimoy negotiates new media arts consultation under <a href="http://jtnimoystudio.com" title="Jtnimoy Studio LLC">Jtnimoy Studio LLC</a>. JT's art prints were recently auctioned at <a href="http://grayarea.org/event/deepdream-the-art-of-neural-networks/">DeepDream: The art of neural networks</a> at Gray Area Foundation for Arts in 2015. JT is into VR, computational creativity, artificial creativity, experimental UX, music composition, synaesthetics, and interesting human culture. Nimoy has always, and probably always will – hack her own prototype apps while up in the creative studio.</p>
<p>In past projects, JT has communicated between technology engineers and creative arts professionals, notoriously amphibious between the two historically clashing communities. Nimoy thinks a lot about issues of programming for non-programmers. She is best known for creating generative computational aesthetics (holograms, fireworks) for Disney's <em>TRON:Legacy</em>. JT's most contagious interactive meme was <a href="http://balldroppings.com" title="Balldroppings"><em>BallDroppings</em></a>, a piece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_art">software art</a> from 2003 whose iOS copycat app was accidentally curated into a show at <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/146247/">Museum of Modern Art</a> in NYC. JT has participated in art-things, or just created solo work that ended up showing in the <a href="http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881803-whitney-biennial-peace-tower-panel">Whitney Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Digital Experience</a>, <a href="http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14882083-interactive-buckyballs">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a>, Württembergischer Kunstverein (Stuttgart), <a href="http://fact.co.uk/">Foundation for Art and Creative Technology</a> (FACT in Liverpool, UK). BallDroppings is permanently installed at <a href="http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/">Computerspielemuseum</a> (Berlin), and permanently installed at <a href="http://www.thepublicstory.com/">The Public</a> (West Bromwich, UK, RIP). JT has been a touted visiting presenter at countless new media festivals and symposiums since 2001. The most visible and accessible work was in film and television, mostly artistic composite effects for high-end tech advertisements produced at a motion graphics studio, by hand programming artisanal small-batch generative code art in collaboration with many.</p>
<p>This site is a public archive of past work. The site originally started as a personal portfolio at age 18, then it grew into a database driven portfolio, then became a blog, then it became a shopify store. It aims to become more of a freelance creative developer portfolio in the near future.</p>
