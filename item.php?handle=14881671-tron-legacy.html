		I spent a half year writing software art to generate
		special effects for Tron Legacy, working at Digital
		Domain with Bradley "GMUNK" Munkowitz, Jake Sargeant, and
		David "dlew" Lewandowski.  This page has taken a long
		time to be published because I've had to await
		clearance. A lot of my team's work was done using
		Adobe software and Cinema 4D. The rest of it got
		written in C++ using OpenFrameworks and wxWidgets, the
		way I've always done it with this team ;) Uniquely
		however, Digital Domain's CG artists were able to port
		my apps over to Houdini for further evolution and
		better rendering than OpenGL could ever
		provide. Special thanks to Andy King for showing me
		that what seasoned CG artists do at DD is actually not
		so far off from what's going on in the Processing
		community.

	In addition to visual effects, I was asked to record myself using a
	unix terminal doing technologically feasible things. I took extra care
	in babysitting the elements through to final composite to ensure that
	the content would not be artistically altered beyond that
	feasibility. I take representing digital culture in film very
	seriously in lieu of having grown up in a world of very badly
	researched user interface greeble. I cringed during the part in
	Hackers (1995) when a screen saver with extruded "equations" is used
	to signify that the hacker has reached some sort of neural flow or
	ambiguous destination. I cringed for Swordfish and Jurassic Park as
	well. I cheered when Trinity in The Matrix used nmap and ssh (and so
	did you). Then I cringed again when I saw that inevitably, Hollywood
	had decided that nmap was the thing to use for all its hacker scenes
	(see Bourne Ultimatum, Die Hard 4, Girl with Dragon Tattoo, The
	Listening, 13: Game of Death, Battle Royale, Broken Saints, and on and
	on). In Tron, the hacker was not supposed to be snooping around on a
	network; he was supposed to kill a process. So we went with posix kill
	and also had him pipe ps into grep. I also ended up using emacs eshell
	to make the terminal more l33t. The team was delighted to see my emacs
	performance -- splitting the editor into nested panes and running
	different modes. I was tickled that I got emacs into a block buster
	movie. I actually do use emacs irl, and although I do not subscribe to
	alt.religion.emacs, I think that's all incredibly relevant to the
	world of Tron.

	HexVirus is a spherical map of the globe that features vector outlines
	of the continents. These continent vectors are slowly eaten away by a
	more hexagonal representation. Algorithmically, this is a path
	stepping function which looks ahead for the closest matching 60-degree
	turns. The HexVirus globe was used in the executive board meeting scene,
	and also inside the grid as a visual aid in CLU's maniacal plan
	presentation. In the board room interface, the globe element is surrounded by the 
	lovely work of my team.

	The scoreboard was the first element I worked on. I created a
	line-generator that produced bursts of lines which turned at
	adjustable angles. The line generator had "radial mode" which arranged
	the geometry in concentric circle form. This line generator was used
	to generate generic elements and layers of style in different things,
	and is a GMUNK favorite.  At this point, I found myself moving to
	multisampled FBOs because the non-antialiased polygons were just too
	ugly to work with, and we needed to make film-resolution renders. In
	fact, this is the highst res I've ever seen my apps render.

<p class="jtnimoy-description">
	Fireworks, mmmm. I started with a regular physics simulation where a
	particle has an upward force applied at birth, sending it upward while
	gravity pulls it back down resulting in a parabola. I then added
	particle-children, followed by various artistic styles, including what
	our team has called "egyptian" across several jobs -- which is a
	side-stepping behavior. We were trying to create fireworks that looked
	enough like real fireworks but had interesting techno-aesthetic. As a
	homage to the original Tron character Bit, we used icosahedrons, dodecahedrons, and similar.
	I was disappointed that Bit isn't in this one. After doing this simulation,
	I've grown more aware of how often fireworks are used in movies.

	For the portal climax, the TronLines app was used, but also apps like
	"Twist" from our team's previous jobs. Once the look was mocked up by gmunk,
	a houdini artist recreated the rig for deeper control.

	I wrote a particle renderer that could make the head holograms
	slurp in and out of the data discs. Special thanks to Keith
	Pasko for CLUing me in about using exponential functions to
	create a sliding-gooey sort of delay.

	When fixing Quorra, there was an element in the DNA interface
	called the Quorra Heart which looked like a lava lamp. I
	generated an isosurface from a perlin-noise volume, using the
	marching cubes function found in the Geometric Tools WildMagic
	API, a truly wonderful lib for coding biodigital jazz, among
	other jazzes. The isosurface was then drawn along different
	axes, including concentric spheres. The app was mesmerizing to
	stare at.

<p class="jtnimoy-description">
	After this project, I was fed up enough with wxWidgets and
	Carbon that I was ready to author my own OpenGL based UI. The
	most important thing I could use is a floating-point slider.
	I also got irritated with the way the Carbon sliders would not
	slide all the way to the minimum and maximum values. It
	totally messed with my zen thing.  Also, after a job like
	this, it's clear that a member of the Processing community
	working within a CG community is greatly restricted by the differences of
	realtime graphics rendering engines, and that probably messes
	with an art director's zen thing.
