      <p>READ_ME 1.2, May 2002 - Textension wins in this digital arts competition. Macros-center, Moscow. The following is a small review written by Ray Thomas of Artmark ((r)[tm]ark). "In terms of aesthetic enjoyment, Textension is a clear winner. It is delightful, exciting, fantastic to play with. It points in many directions at once, suggesting that hypertext could be fun and beautiful and profound in all kinds of new ways that it isn't today. Interestingly, the way to this development is pointed out by the typewriter, which produced beautiful things through the physical action of metal. Textension is the first piece of software to pick up effectively this very lost thread."</p>
